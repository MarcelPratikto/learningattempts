/* * weatherlog_t  */

/* A particular weather sensor called the WeatherJuicer 2000 TM stores a */
/* log entry each day, representing weather activity from the */
/* previous 24 hours. Each entry includes a: */

/* - year :: 6 bits -- stored as the number of years since the */
/*           year 2000. */
/* - month :: 4 bits */
/* - day :: 5 bits */
/* - zip_code :: 16 bits */
/* - high_temp :: in degrees Fahrenheit, stored as an 8-bit signed integer */
/* - low_temp :: in degrees Fahrenheit, stored as 8-bit signed integer */
/* - precipitation :: in mm. stored as a 10-bit unsigned integer. */
/* - average_wind_speed :: 7 bits. unsigned int km/hr. */

/* All of these are packed into a 64 bit unsigned integer in the above order. */

/* For example, if on September 16, 2015, on Temple's main campus, which */
/* is in zip code 19122, we have 15 mm of rain, a high temperature of 85 */
/* degrees, a low temperature of 65 degrees, and an average wind speed of */
/* 5 km/hour. */

/* We'd store: */
/* - year :: 2015, which is 15 years from 2000, so 001111 */
/* - month :: September, which is the 9th month, so 1001. */
/* - day :: 16, which is 1 0000 */
/* - zip_code :: 19122 which is 0100 1010 1011 0010 */
/* - high_temp :: 85F, so 0101 0101 */
/* - low_temp :: 65F, so 0100 0001 */
/* - precipitation :: 35 mm so 00 0010 0011 */
/* - average wind speed :: 5 km/h, so 000 0101 */

/* And all would be packed into a single 64-bit unsigned integer: */

/* 00 1111 1001 10000 0100 1010 1011 0010 0101 0101 0100 0001 00 0010 0011 000 0101 */

/* OR */

/* 0011 1110 0110 0000 1001 0101 0110 0100 1010 1010 1000 0010 0001 0001 1000 0101 */
